# Repair vs. Replace: Making the Right Choice for Heritage Windows

Heritage windows are more than just glass and timber; they’re part of your home’s story. When damage occurs, homeowners often face the dilemma of repairing versus replacing. In this article, we’ll break down the factors that influence your decision.

## When to Repair

Many common window issues—sticking sashes, cracked panes, or failing putty—are easily repaired with the right materials and know‑how. Repairing helps retain original craftsmanship and often aligns better with heritage guidelines.

## When to Replace

Severely rotted frames or significant structural damage may warrant replacement. Modern replica windows can be crafted to match period style while improving energy efficiency. Always consult your local council to ensure replacements meet heritage requirements.
