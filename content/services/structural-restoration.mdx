## The Engineering of Heritage Structures

Heritage buildings possess structural systems that modern engineering often misunderstands. From the flexible timber framing of Victorian terraces to the load-bearing brickwork of Federation homes, each period demands specific structural knowledge that respects original design intent while ensuring safety and longevity.

### Understanding Heritage Structural Systems

Sydney's heritage properties were built using construction methods that modern codes don't always accommodate:

- **Victorian Timber Framing**: Balloon framing, hand-sawn members, traditional joinery
- **Federation Brick Construction**: Double brick walls, timber floor systems, minimal foundations
- **Colonial Stone & Timber**: Rubble stone foundations, heavy timber framing
- **Traditional Movement Accommodation**: Designed for natural material movement and settlement

Each structural system requires engineering solutions that provide necessary strength with minimal impact on historical fabric.
