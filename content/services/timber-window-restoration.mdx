## The Art of Traditional Window Restoration

Original timber windows are among the most character-defining features of Sydney's heritage properties. From six-panel Victorian doors to elegant Federation sash windows, each period demands specific restoration approaches that respect the original joinery and craftsmanship.

### Understanding Period Window Craftsmanship

Sydney's heritage windows were built using techniques that modern manufacturing has largely abandoned. Our specialists understand:

- **Victorian Sash Windows**: Counterweight systems, slender glazing bars
- **Federation Casements**: Stout joinery, leadlight features, generous proportions  
- **Colonial Six-Panel Doors**: Hand-planed timber, traditional mortise and tenon joints
- **Early French Doors**: Multi-pane configurations, elegant proportions

Each window type requires specific restoration approaches that preserve original glass, hardware, and joinery while ensuring another century of service.
