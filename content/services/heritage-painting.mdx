## The Art of Period Paint & Finishes

Original paint schemes and finishes are crucial to understanding and preserving the architectural intent of heritage properties. From the deep rich tones of Victorian interiors to the softer Federation palettes, each period demands specific knowledge of traditional materials and application techniques.

### Understanding Heritage Colour Systems

Sydney's heritage properties followed distinct colour philosophies that our specialists understand:

- **Victorian Colour Theory**: Deep, rich tones reflecting industrial pigments and social status
- **Federation Arts & Crafts**: Softer, natural palettes inspired by Australian landscape
- **Colonial Practicality**: Limewash and simple oil-based finishes for durability
- **Traditional Application**: Brush marks, application methods that replicate original work

Each period requires specific paint removal, surface preparation, and application techniques that preserve underlying surfaces and historical integrity.
