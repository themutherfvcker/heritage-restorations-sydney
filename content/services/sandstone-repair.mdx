## The Craft of Traditional Stonework

Sydney's golden sandstone defines the character of our heritage architecture. From the delicate carvings of Victorian terraces to the robust foundations of early colonial buildings, each stone tells a story of craftsmanship that demands specialist knowledge to preserve.

### Understanding Sydney Sandstone

Our local sandstone varies significantly in composition and durability. Our specialists understand:

- **Yellowblock Sandstone**: Pyrmont and Balmain quarries, fine-grained, golden hue
- **Hawkesbury Sandstone**: Richer color, coarser grain, from Gosford and Hornsby
- **Shell-lime Mortar**: Original bedding material that breathes with the stone
- **Traditional Carving**: Hand-tooled details that define each architectural period

Each sandstone type requires specific repair approaches that match original quarry sources and traditional stoneworking techniques.
