### Understanding Period Plaster Styles

Sydney's heritage interiors followed distinct plaster traditions that our specialists understand:

- **Victorian High Style**: Elaborate cornices, deep mouldings, complex ceiling roses
- **Federation Simplicity**: Softer profiles, Australian motifs, Arts & Crafts influence
- **Colonial Practicality**: Simple cornices, minimal ornamentation, practical detailing
- **Traditional Composition**: Lime-based plasters, hair reinforcement, hand-tooled finishes

Each plaster style requires specific repair, replication, and finishing techniques that match original workmanship and material composition.
