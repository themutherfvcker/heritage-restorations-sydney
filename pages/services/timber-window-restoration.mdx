# Expert Timber Window Restoration for Heritage Homes

Preserve the original character of your period home with specialist timber window restoration. Original sash windows are a defining feature of Sydney's heritage properties, and we have the expertise to restore them to their former glory.

## Common Timber Window Issues We Solve:

*   **Stuck or Draughty Sash Windows**
*   **Broken Sash Cords and Weights**
*   **Rot in Bottom Rails and Sills**
*   **Deteriorated Putty and Glazing**
*   **Paint Build-Up Preventing Operation**

## Our Heritage Window Restoration Process

1.  **Assessment:** We evaluate each window's condition, identifying repairable elements versus those needing replacement.
2.  **Careful Disassembly:** Windows are carefully taken apart to preserve original glass and joinery.
3.  **Timber Repair:** We use traditional techniques to repair rot and damage, often splicing in new timber rather than full replacement.
4.  **Hardware Restoration:** Sash cords, weights, and pulleys are restored or replaced with period-appropriate materials.
5.  **Reassembly & Finishing:** Windows are reassembled, re-puttied, and finished with heritage-appropriate paints.

**Restore your original windows instead of replacing them with modern alternatives.**
