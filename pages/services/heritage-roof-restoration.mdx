## The Art of Traditional Roof Restoration

Heritage roofs tell the story of Sydney's architectural evolution. From the Welsh slate of early Victorian terraces to the distinctive terracotta tiles of Federation homes, each period demands specific knowledge and traditional techniques.

### Understanding Period Roofing

Sydney's heritage roofs were built to last centuries using materials and methods that modern construction has largely forgotten. Our specialists understand:

- **Victorian Welsh Slate**: Thin, durable sheets from North Wales
- **Federation Terracotta**: French-profile tiles with lime mortar bedding  
- **Early Colonial Shingles**: Hand-split timber for the first Sydney homes
- **Traditional Iron**: Corrugated roofing for Victorian additions

Each material requires specific restoration approaches that respect the original craftsmanship while ensuring another century of protection.
